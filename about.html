      I love being with a computer writing lines of code. I found out about web
      design in 2019 and immediately fell in love with the art.

      <p></p>
      I have no certificate yet but i am working towards getting my first degree
      (Bachelor in Science) in computer science. I have always enjoyed learning
      the principle behind how things work.

      <p></p>
      When I am not coding, I am baking or making YouTube videos for my favourte
      football team Arsenal.

      <p></p>
      I am someone who lives by the saying; "whatever is worth doing is worth
      doing well". I like going out of my way to ensure work is done properly
      and on time.
